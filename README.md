# Pokemon-Analytics

This project leverages [PokemonShowdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/)'s public API to fetch top competitive pokemon teams.
It fetches the current highest rated players on the a given ladder and goes through their recent games, saving what pokemons they used, with what moves and items.


## Setup

To run it, make sure you have python installed on a version >= 3.0. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the root of the project. Last, adapt the `main.py` however needed and run `python main.py`.
